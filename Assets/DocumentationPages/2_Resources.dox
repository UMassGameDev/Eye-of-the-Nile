\note I missed a small but critical instruction in the setting up GitHub and Unity video. After I add you as a collaborator to the GitHub project,
you have then accept the invite from your email BEFORE you can procede with the rest of the tutorial. Otherwise, you will make a fork (your own,
separate version) of the project on your GitHub account instead.

There's another thing I missed that's more clarifying than important. When you first download GitHub Desktop, your first need to CLONE the repository.
This the second button the right when you first open the app. You can use the link to our GitHub to accomplish this. This is the step that actually downloads
the repository with all our files onto your computer.

For questions on Unity, there's countless helpful resources online (You can also ask in the Discord). We encourage you to follow tutorials for features that
are a bit over your head. That's how you learn!
