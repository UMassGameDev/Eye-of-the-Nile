\section Scenes_General General

\subsubsection Scenes_Anubis Anubis.unity
When the player dies, this scene is automatically loaded. The player falls for a short amount of time before landing in front of Anubis. Based on how
you died, a random joke is selected for Anubis to tell you. There’s a portal on the left that will respawn the player at the last warp obelisk they touched.

\subsubsection Scenes_Geb Geb.unity
The site of the first bossfight on the game. It consists of a flat open sandy area and Geb, the god of rocks. To see more information about Geb, visit our
concept doc in \ref Resources.

\subsubsection Scenes_MainMenu MainMenu.unity
Contains the main menu of the game, which includes a play button and a settings menu. This scene is the first to load when the user launches the game.

\subsubsection Scenes_Skyhub Skyhub.unity
If the player holds the interact button (E) at warp obelisk instead of just pressing it, they will be brought to the Skyhub. There are more features that
will be added to the Skyhub, but in its current form, the player can talk to Ma’at using the interact key, opening up the ability inventory. In this UI,
the player can manage their abilities, deciding which ones they want to use and reading up on what each one does. The player can then use another warp
obelisk to return to where they were before. This warp obelisk does not let you set your respawn point, but only teleports back.
