/** \brief
Functionality of ObjectHealth, specifically for the player.
This script inherits from ObjectHealth. Here are the key changes:
- Some variables get their values from the PlayerStatHolder component instead of inside this script.
- Support for damage resistance and fire resistance stats.
- When the player dies, \ref Scenes_Anubis is loaded, where Anubis tells joke based on how the player died.
- 5 different events are available for other functions in other scripts to subscribe to. Many of these are used by the data manager.
- A function is available mainly for abilities to use that instantly heals the player.
