/*!<summary>
Handles timed events related to abilities. Specifically, charge ups, activating the ability, repeated events during
duration time (such as healing over time), and cooldowns.
It also holds useful data, namely the OwnerTransform (playerâ€™s transform), the ability info this ability is using,
and the current ability state (ready to use vs on cooldown).
