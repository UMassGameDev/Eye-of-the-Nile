/** \brief
This script is used by a small trigger zone beneath some entities' feet (including the player) that detects if they are on the ground.
When the entity is on the floor, isGrounded will be true.

NOTE: This detects the layer(s) selected on this script in the inspector, which is not necessarily the "Ground" layer!
The selected layers should usually be set to "Ground" and "Collision"
This script can only detect objects that have colliders.
