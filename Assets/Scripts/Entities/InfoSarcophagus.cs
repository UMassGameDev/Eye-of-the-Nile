/** \brief
This script controls the functionality of tutorial sarcophagi.
"The player will encounter sarcophaguses with the ghost of Osiris in it to receive tips from him at relevant moments.
This consists of a basic animation and speech bubble thatâ€™s triggered when the player gets within range."
This script is simple enough that it could probably be applied to other types of objects and it would still work.
