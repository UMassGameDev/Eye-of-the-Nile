/** \brief
Basic projectile functionality that every other projectile type must inherit from to be compatible with other systems (like the attack manager).
You can also put this script onto any object or prefab to give it normal projectile functionality.

Documentation updated 11/13/2024
\author Stephen Nuttall, Roy Pascual
\note This script no longer handles projectile movement on its own. Instead, it supports any script that inherits from RudimentaryMovement,
which must be attached separately. This is to make BaseProjectile a more universal solution to projectiles, since each projectile moves differently.
\todo Replace damagePlayers and damageNonPlayers bools with one layer mask that allows for more choices in what is damaged.
