/** \brief
This script is a work in progress. It will control Geb's movement and will trigger Geb's attacks.
This script consists of:
- 6 functions that get called only once when Geb enters a new phase, one for each phase (except for the first one).
- 7 functions that get called every frame depending on Geb's phase, one for each phase.
