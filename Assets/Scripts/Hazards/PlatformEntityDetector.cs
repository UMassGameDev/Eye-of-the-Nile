/** \brief
Used by a trigger zone on every moving platform.
Detect entities to them that stand on the moving platform.
Objects that are tilemaps or do not have Rigidbody2D's attached (such as GroundDetectors) do not get detected.
Technically, this script could work for things other than moving platforms, so maybe this script should be more generalized.
