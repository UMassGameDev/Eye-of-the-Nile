# Eye of the Nile

**Eye of the Nile** is a 2D platformer with Metroidvania elements, developed by the UMass Lowell Game Development Club from Fall 2023 to Spring 2025. Set in a stylized ancient Egypt, the game follows Horus, the god of the sky, on a quest to free his fellow gods from the mind-control curse of his brother, Seth, the god of chaos.
